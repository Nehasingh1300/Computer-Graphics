Fractals are self repeating mathematical constructs. That lead to complex models that are organic in design. While many fractal patterns were used a screensave or backgrounds of early 2000s computer, they many a multude of applications within computer graphics for modeling organic structures.

- B-Trees (Grammar Generated) :o: ( April 7, 2020 )
    
>*Each of the Fractal designs may have a unquie compilation signature which will be specified within a header at the top of each file.*
